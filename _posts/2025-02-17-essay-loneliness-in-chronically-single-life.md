# Loneliness in Chronically Single Life: The Social Construction of Romantic Fulfillment

Loneliness lingers beneath the surface of my single life. Last year, I sought therapy for depression and have been continuing to read self-help books to process my feelings. At times, when scrolling across social media such as the r/dating sub in Reddit, I realize my loneliness is not an uncommon social phenomenon among single people. I wonder, where do those feelings of loneliness originate from broad social perspectives?

As Kruger et al. (2023, pp. 1195, 1199) point out, loneliness is an “emotion of absence” characterized by a painful awareness that certain social goods are missing and out of reach. The experience of loneliness arises from the absence of presence in the world, others, and the things and spaces that shape our shared lives. The paper (p. 1200) further discusses the relationship between depression and loneliness. It implies that loneliness is one of the main characteristics of depression, and depressed individuals report feeling less able to engage in particular interpersonal relationships in rewarding and fulfilling ways.

This raises several questions for me: why does the lack of a romantic connection leave me unfulfilled even though I have adequate meaningful platonic connections with a handful of individuals? What specific social goods am I perceived to be missing out on in my single life that contributes to this feeling of loneliness?

One possible explanation lies in the way romantic relationships are socially constructed as the primary way to find meaningful connections and the source of happiness as feminism studies have long observed and contested (Illouz, 2012, p. 4). Sara Ahmed (2006, p. 174, as cited in Eleanor, 2022) observes that we are all guided along the “straight line”, which is a societal alignment with heteronormative ideals of the ideal existence - one that prioritizes coupledom, marriage, the nuclear family, and a supposedly happy existence within these structures. In contrast, the cultural construction of loneliness is built by depicting those who live alone, particularly the single and the unattached, as the loneliest figures. One well-known figure of such a stereotype is the “crazy cat lady”, a woman whose failure to secure romantic love is seen as a defining shortcoming (Eleanor, 2022). This cultural narrative suggests that failing to attain romantic love equates to failing to achieve ultimate happiness and personal fulfillment.

Beyond being framed as a source of happiness, romantic love is also closely linked to personal identity and self-worth, a perspective that feminist scholars have challenged (Illouz, 2012, p. 4). In particular, women face intense societal pressure to be both professionally successful and sexually desirable. In Misogyny: Japanese Woman Disgust (2015, pp. 194-195), Chizuko Ueno discusses how these dual expectations shape women's experiences of self-worth. She argues that even highly accomplished women often internalize misogynistic narratives that suggest their achievements are insufficient if they are not also romantically chosen and desired by men. In this framework, a woman who remains single is perceived as not only “unwanted and undesired” but also as fundamentally incomplete. Without the validation of romantic attention, she is rendered invisible in the social order, failing to be fully present to the “Others”, particularly men.

In reflecting on my own experiences,  I realize that loneliness in my single life is shaped by societal narratives that equate fulfillment with romantic love. Cultural expectations frame coupledom as the ideal, while singlehood is seen as incomplete, especially for women, who face pressure to be both successful and desirable. Though platonic relationships offer support, they do not counteract these messages. Recognizing these influences is a crucial step in challenging the internalized belief that romance is the only—or even the most essential—path to meaning and fulfillment in life.
